# Hi there, I'm Carlos

Developer from Nicaragua, currently living in Argentina and studying computer engineering @ University of Buenos Aires. I'm a creative person, someone who is passionate about text editors, CLI based applications, and just programming languages overall. I'm also starting to fall in love with core computer science concepts and I'm trying to dig a little bit more into those kinds of topics.

- 🧠 I'm looking to collaborate with cool people who undestand I'm still learning.
- 🛠️ Continuously customizing my development environment.
- 💾 Talk to me about tech, that's what I love, tech.
- 🤬 Fun fact: Actually there's nothing funny about me.
