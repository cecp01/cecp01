# Hi there, I'm Carlos

I'm a developer from Nicaragua, currently living in Argentina and studying computer engineering @ University of Buenos Aires. I would describe myself as a creative person, someone who is passionate about development, mostly web user interfaces. I'm also interested in math, science and sharing my knowledge with others.

- 🐹 Focusing heavily on learning Golang.
- 🧠 I'm looking to collaborate with cool people who undestand I'm still learning.
- 🛠️ Continuously customizing my development environment.
- 💾 Talk to me about tech, that's what I love, tech.
- 🤬 Fun fact: Actually there's nothing funny about me.
