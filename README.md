# Hi there, I'm Carlos

I'm a developer from Nicaragua, currently living in Argentina and studying computer engineering @ University of Buenos Aires. I would describe myself as a creative person, someone who is passionate about development, mostly web user interfaces. I'm also interested in math, science and sharing my knowledge with others.

**Skills:** 🖌️ CSS | 🦢 TailwindCSS | 👨‍💻 Javascript | ⚛️ ReactJS | 🐍 Python

- 🚧 Currently working on my YouTube channel.
- 🧠 I'm looking to collaborate with cool people who undestand I'm still learning.
- 💾 Talk to me about tech, that's what I love, tech.
- 🤬 Fun fact: Actually there's nothing funny about me.

Numbers don't tell the whole story, but they certainly look cool on your profile readme, so here are some of my stats and repos. Hope you find something useful or at least something you like.
