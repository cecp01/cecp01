### Hi, I'm Carlos

## I'm a computer engineering student @ University of Buenos Aires. I love web development, and that's about it. Also, I love React.

- 💻 I'm currently working on some side proyects, that's why my profile is empty, for now at least.
- 🖌️ I'm currently learning ReactJS and web design overall, alongside reinforcing my knowledge of the basic front-end technolgies.
- 🧠 I'm looking to collaborate with cool people who undestand I'm still learning the basics.
- 📖 I'm also looking for help with my midterms and finals at college please (just kidding).
- 💾 Talk to me about tech, that's what I love, tech.
- 👨 Pronouns: he/him
- 🤬 Fun fact: Actually there's nothing funny about me.

I'm not that much of a social media guy, but here you go: 🐦[twitter][twitter] **|** 📷[instagram][instagram]
