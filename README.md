# Hi, I'm Carlos

Developer from Nicaragua, currently living in Argentina and studying computer engineering. I'm a creative person, someone who is passionate about text editors, CLI based applications, and programming languages.

- Looking to collaborate with cool people who undestand I'm still learning.
- Continuously customizing my development environment.
- Talk to me about tech, that's what I love.
- Fun fact: Actually there's nothing funny about me.
