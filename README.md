I'm a developer from Nicaragua, currently living in Argentina and studying computer engineering @ University of Buenos Aires. I would describe myself as a creative person, someone who is passionate about development, mostly web user interfaces. I'm also interested in math, science and sharing my knowledge with others.

- ðŸ’¾ Talk to me about tech, that's what I love, tech.
- ðŸ¤¬ Fun fact: Actually there's nothing funny about me.
